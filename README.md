Pam's HarvestCraft 
================

This is a fork of Pam's HarvestCraft, which expands minecraft's food system.  
The aim is to clean the code, fix bugs and readd features from 1.7.10. 
I do not own the code, it belongs to MatrexsVigil!

### Installation
- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/lebertran/harvestcraft/releases) or build the mod (see below).
- Move the jar to the Forge mods folder.

### Build
- Clone this repository
- Open a command line in the cloned directory
- (only for modders) run ```gradlew.bat setupDecompWorkspace```
- run ```gradlew.bat build```.
